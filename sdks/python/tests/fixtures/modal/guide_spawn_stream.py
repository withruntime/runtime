# Source: https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox-spawn (https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox-spawn.md),
# code block 4 (python notest), read 18 October 2026.
# Copied verbatim; the only change is Modal's import, to `from withruntime import modal`.
# Modal's guide runs its blocks with modal already imported, so the import is added.
# Names the page leaves to its reader (app, my_app, sb_app) are given by the live runner,
# as Modal's docs harness gives `fixture:sb_app`: an App from modal.App.lookup.

    # Lines preserve the trailing newline character, so use end="" to avoid double newlines.
    print(line, end="")
p.wait()
sb.terminate()
