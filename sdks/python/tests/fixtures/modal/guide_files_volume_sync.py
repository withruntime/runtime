# Source: https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox-files (https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox-files.md),
# code block 14 (python notest), read 18 October 2026.
# Copied verbatim; the only change is Modal's import, to `from withruntime import modal`.
# Modal's guide runs its blocks with modal already imported, so the import is added.
# Names the page leaves to its reader (app, my_app, sb_app) are given by the live runner,
# as Modal's docs harness gives `fixture:sb_app`: an App from modal.App.lookup.

from withruntime import modal

sb = modal.Sandbox.create(
    volumes={"/data": modal.Volume.from_name("my-v2-volume")},
    app=my_app,
)

# Write files to the volume
sb.exec("bash", "-c", "echo 'hello' > /data/output.txt").wait()

# Commit changes immediately
p = sb.exec("sync", "/data")
p.wait()
if p.returncode != 0:
    raise Exception(f"sync failed with exit code {p.returncode}")

# Changes are now persisted and visible to other containers
sb.terminate()
