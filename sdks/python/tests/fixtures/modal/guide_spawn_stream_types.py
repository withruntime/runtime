# code block 5 (python notest), read 18 October 2026.
# Copied verbatim; the only change is Modal's import, to `from withruntime import modal`.
# Modal's guide runs its blocks with modal already imported, so the import is added.
# Names the page leaves to its reader (app, my_app, sb_app) are given by the live runner,
# as Modal's docs harness gives `fixture:sb_app`: an App from modal.App.lookup.

from withruntime import modal
from withruntime.modal.stream_type import StreamType

sb = modal.Sandbox.create(app=my_app)

# Default behavior: buffered in memory.
p = sb.exec(
    "bash",
    "-c",
    "echo foo; echo bar >&2",
    stdout=StreamType.PIPE,
    stderr=StreamType.PIPE,
)
print(p.stdout.read())
print(p.stderr.read())

# Print the stream to STDOUT as it comes in.
p = sb.exec(
    "bash",
    "-c",
    "echo foo; echo bar >&2",
    stdout=StreamType.STDOUT,
    stderr=StreamType.STDOUT,
)
p.wait()

# Discard all output.
